            <h2>Information Technology Track</h2>
            <br>
            <p>In the Information Technology track, my primary goal is to become proficient either as a database administrator or a web developer. 
                I find immense satisfaction in designing websites, an endeavor that allows me to express and enhance my creativity.
                 Admittedly, while this course is not my natural inclination, I've encountered challenges in learning its intricacies.
                  Nonetheless, I am gradually adapting and learning how to embrace and appreciate every aspect of it, even finding a 
                  growing affection for the challenges and difficulties that come with the learning process.</p>

            <h2>Adventure</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Once I have a stable situation, I dream of traveling across my country and the world. 
                I want to explore different cultures, try new foods from each province in my country, and understand people's perspectives. 
                It's not just about sightseeing but appreciating the diversity that makes our world interesting.</p>

        <div class="Business">
            <h2>Business</h2>
            <br>
            <p>I aspire to establish a thriving business by the age of 40, not as a source of pressure but as an inspiration and personal goal. 
                As I accumulate valuable experience in the business realm, my ultimate vision is to create an IT firm that provides a range of services and products. 
                Additionally, nurturing a childhood dream, I also aim to own a coffee shop or a cafe. 
                Given my passion for coffee and pastries, owning a cafe aligns perfectly with my interests and would be a fulfilling venture for me.</p>
